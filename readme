A chatango library with a flexible manager.


Requirements: This library requires at this time to have python 3 or greater installed.


Specifics:

First, I would like to say that there is a particular method that is built in that allows for total post deletion
without requiring being a group owner. I would advise this method to be sparsely used as it sends a good chunk of data.

Due to the nature of group connections, if there is more than 1 page of post history, then it must first be loaded
into the bot via loadHist. This is the equivalent of pressing the "history" button repeatedly on the top of
each group window until you cannot go back further. Without this, the bot cannot know what to delete.
When all history posts are queue'd, then recvHistLoad will be called if enabled.


Second, chatango will give announcements via in-chat popups, though it isn't guarentee'd it will display correctly
through recvAnnouncement due to lack of announcements, just guarentee'd that you will see the text it gives.



Method enabling:

There are some methods that are disabled by default but can be enabled if needed.
If there is a method that you want to enable, find it by looking for the lines that start with "#self.recv"
followed by the method name. Delete the hashtag and add the method with self followed by its arguments in the bot.
If there is "pass" directly underneath the method name, this can be commented out or removed.
